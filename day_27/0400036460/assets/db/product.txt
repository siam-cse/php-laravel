It’s a staple you can wear to work, the gym, and on a date. Plus, as Justin Vaughan, a perfumer and the founder of the incense brand Ponsont, puts it, a black tee is the perfect high-low uniform. “I can just as easily kick it with a farmer in Virginia as I can take a meeting in the city,” he says. As is the story with all basics, the black shirt comes in many variations — and, when shopping for one, it’s important to consider the material, fit, style, and weight.
